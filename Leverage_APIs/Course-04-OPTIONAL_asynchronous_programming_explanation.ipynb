    "Asynchronous programming is a type of parallel programming in which a unit of work is allowed to run separately from the primary application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread about completion or failure of the worker thread. There are numerous benefits to using it, such as improved application performance and enhanced responsiveness.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll get back to this in future lectures but it is important to have in mind that when dealing with computers, we are using physical elements to make calculations for us and transmit data to each other etc and these operations take time. Let's take a look at different execution times per operations for various elements of a computer:\n",

    "- Memory ≈ 100 ns\n",
    "- Disk ≈ 20 μs\n",
    "- Network ≈ 150 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine we are trying to make many API calls (wild, I know) in a loop over a list of urls. What will happen is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter the loop code (CPU)\n",
    "2. Get data to write the query from the url list (Memory)\n",

    "Now if we make the part of the code that deals with the API asychronous, then we do not have to wait for the API to respond to start sending new queries, causing the total execution time of the loop to be much quicker!
